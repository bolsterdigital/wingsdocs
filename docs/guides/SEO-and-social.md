If you click the 'Platforms' tab, you can configure the following:

- **Featured**: the title, description and image that is displayed when using the 'nodes' or 'campaign' card. These settings are also used for search engines and social media, **unless** you configure these separately:
- **Search Engines**: set a title and description to override what you have configured on the 'Featured' tab.
- **Facebook**: set a title, description and meta image for Facebook and other social media platforms, which are used to display a 'card' when any user shares a link to the page you are editing on social media. The Facebook settings are also used for Twitter and WhatsApp, **unless** you configure those separately
- **Twitter**: enter details here if you want to use a different title, description and image than you have configured for Facebook.
- **WhatsApp**: configure a default share message.
