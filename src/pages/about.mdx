# Powering progressive change.

Wings was built by [Bolster](https://bolster.digital), a Dutch ideologically driven digital agency, to help progressive organizations worldwide to help bring about a better world, focusing on social equality, economic justice, and the fight against climate change.

Wings and Bolster were founded & are led by Jaap Stronks (@[jaapstronks](https://twitter.com/jaapstronks)). Wings started out as a headless CMS service, allowing us to create modern bespoken campaign websites for our clients, mostly Green & social democrat political campaign websites as well as digital platforms for labour unions.

As Wings evolved, it steadily gained [features](/features); with the addition of a built-in front-end service, it became a full-fledged website-as-a-service in 2020. Wings is built in Rotterdam, The Netherlands.
