# Wings: an alternative to The Action Network

Are you interested in how The Action Network compares to alternative platforms, such as Wings?

Wings is a campaigning website service built for digital organizing, with excellent **The Action Network integration** options.

:::tip Summary
Wings and The Action Network **complement** each other:

- Wings **replaces just The Action Network frontend** with a great campaign website.
- The Action Network offers a [complex toolset](https://actionnetwork.org) for **building engagement**. If you have that level of digital professionalism, you probably also want a better campaigning website like Wings which integrates with your emailing & messaging platform.
- Organizations who look for a powerful but more simple toolset, often start out with **Wings + Mailchimp**, but later switch to **Wings + The Action Network**.

## Wings and The Action Network similarities

Wings and The Action Network share a few similarities:

- Both allow you to manage and host signup campaigns, petitions, events and fundraisers;
- Both may only be used by progressive organizations (not by right-wing / conservative political parties), so you will not be indirectly supporting movements you do not agree with.

## Differences between The Action Network and Wings

- Wings gives you an entire website with pages, articles and campaigns, integrated.
- Wings only has an email service for confirmation emails, but does not let you send email newsletters to your supporters.
- Wings sends confirmed user data to connected services _such as The Action Network_, who specialize in newsletters, engagement building and voter activation.
