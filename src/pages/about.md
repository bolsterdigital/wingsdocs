# Wings, by Bolster.

Wings is a website service which is developed and maintained by a company called Bolster. Bolster was a Dutch digital agency for progressive organizations, focusing on topics such as social equality, economic justice, and the fight against climate change. Since 2021, Bolster has focused 100% on Wings â€“ that's why the domain [bolster.digital](https://bolster.digital) now points to the page you are currently on. ðŸ‘‹

Wings and Bolster were founded & are led by Jaap Stronks (@[jaapstronks](https://twitter.com/jaapstronks)). Wings started out as a headless CMS service, allowing us to create modern bespoke campaign websites for our clients, mostly Green & social democrat political campaign websites as well as digital platforms for labour unions.

As Wings evolved, it steadily gained [features](/features); with the addition of a built-in front-end service, it became a full-fledged website-as-a-service in 2020. Wings is developed in Rotterdam, The Netherlands.
