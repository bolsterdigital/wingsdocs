Mastodon is a free, open-source, decentralized microblogging platform that is quickly gaining popularity among not-for-profits and other progressive organizations. This platform offers a number of important advantages over the more mainstream options such as Twitter and Facebook, and is well worth considering for organizations that want to take control of their online presence and reach out to their supporters in a more effective way.

One of the key drivers of Mastodon's success is its use of ActivityPub, an open, decentralized networking protocol that is implemented by Mastodon, but also used by platforms such as Pixelfed (an Instagram alternative) and Peertube (which could replace YouTube). Mastodon is made up of a network of interconnected instances that are run by various organizations and individuals.  

ActivityPub is what enables Mastodon's federated, decentralized structure, which means that it is not controlled by a single company or entity. Using Mastodon also helps to decrease our reliance on big tech companies such as Twitter and Facebook. These companies have a history of using their dominant positions to stifle competition and suppress progressive voices, and it is important for organizations to have alternatives that they can turn to. By using Mastodon, organizations can take back control of their online presence and engage with their supporters in a more open and inclusive way.

Mastodon also places a strong emphasis on accessibility, with a focus on providing an easy-to-use interface and robust support for assistive technologies and a culture that promotes accessible editorial practices such as adding ALT tags to images. This makes it a great option for organizations that want to make their content accessible to as many people as possible, regardless of their abilities or technological expertise.

At Wings, we understand the importance of these issues, and we offer our clients access to an exclusive Mastodon instance at [social.wings.dev](https://social.wings.dev). By using this instance, organizations can take advantage of the many benefits of Mastodon and engage with their supporters in a more effective and meaningful way.
