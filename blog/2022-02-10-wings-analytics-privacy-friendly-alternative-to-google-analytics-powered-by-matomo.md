As a website-as-a-service provider, we understand the importance of privacy and compliance for not-for-profit organizations. That's why we're excited to introduce Wings Analytics, a self-hosted server running Matomo.

Matomo is an open-source analytics platform that offers many benefits for not-for-profit organizations. One of the biggest advantages of using Matomo is that it is privacy-friendly and helps organizations stay compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). We host Matomo ourselves, exclusively for our clients â€“ which is a stark contrast to Google, which offers Google Analytics for free but makes money using harvesting private user information and selling ads.

In addition to its privacy-friendly features, Matomo also offers several other benefits for not-for-profit organizations. Because it is open-source, organizations can customize and extend the platform to meet their specific needs. This can help organizations save money on licensing fees and avoid being locked into a proprietary analytics platform.

Furthermore, using Matomo can help organizations decrease their reliance on big tech organizations like Google, which offers Google Analytics. By using a self-hosted analytics platform like Matomo, organizations can avoid sending their data to third-party servers and maintain control over their data.

Overall, we believe that Matomo is an excellent choice for not-for-profit organizations looking for a privacy-friendly and GDPR-compliant analytics solution. By using Wings Analytics, organizations can take advantage of the benefits of Matomo without having to worry about the technical details of setting up and running their own server.
