If you want to take your digital organizing to the next level, you need to be able to connect various online services. The video below shows you how to recruit volunteers when you launch an online petition with Wings. It is as easy as adding a checkbox that says "I want to volunteer", and using Wings's Webhooks support to send these submissions to a service like Trello, which lets you automatically create todo's, assign coworkers who should follow up on these tasks, and even add a due date set 2 days in the future.
